This whole thing is just a quick proof-of-concept in an effort to
flush out feasibility and _what_ is needed.

- There needs to be a rate limiter. Cannot be too many calls to
action, however, we may want to log everything.

- start-up config file. This could have a whitelist of users.

- need a direct interface to IPTABLES.

Does it really make sense to build something? Perhaps prelude
has it all, or maybe it has too much.
