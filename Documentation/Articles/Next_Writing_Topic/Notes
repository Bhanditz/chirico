GWT and APE plus access to spreadsheets. Okay give an overview?
How would that work?

GWT (AJAX) and demonstrate making calls to APE. From APE you could
show how to make calls to a spreadsheet.

What is one of the problems with GAE? (No cron, so demonstrate how
to do cron from (C, Python, Java) from a small box. Note, this could
then lead into a second article about the soekris box.

That could have several layers (Kernel boot process), or managing networks
and the bridge tools. However, I want to stick with something closer to what
I may have to use for work.

Back to the GWT/APE article. May want to show authentication. What would
really be good is learning more about big table and how data should be 
stored in big table.
