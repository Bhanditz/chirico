If you want a page at github, then, read the following:

  http://pages.github.com/

  git fetch origin 

  http://mchirico.github.com/chirico/


This was taken from the google code page. Here's what
I did to set this up. Note this was not done for chirico


Global setup:
 Set up git
  git config --global user.name "Mike Chirico"
  git config --global user.email mchirico@gmail.com
      
Next steps:
  mkdir 23prime
  cd 23prime
  git init
  touch README
  git add README
  git commit -m 'first commit'
  git remote add origin git@github.com:mchirico/23prime.git
  git push -u origin master
      
Existing Git Repo?
  cd existing_git_repo
  git remote add origin git@github.com:mchirico/23prime.git
  git push -u origin master







Getting Back a Deleted File

# Examples of how to get a file back
#   Suppose you deleted git_usage/Notes, then, you 
#   also committed the delete.
#
# Here are the steps to get it back

cd ~/dev/23prime
m=$(git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- git_usage/Notes)
git show --pretty="format:" --name-only ${m}
git checkout ${m}^ -- git_usage/Notes
git add git_usage/Notes


If you need more information, see the following:

  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout.html




$ git ls-files --deleted
Assuming that looks like what you want, go ahead and checkout each file back from the index.

$ git ls-files -d | xargs git checkout --


trouble add directories to git?

So which download get used?

I seem to have better luck with this one, at least
it doesn't ask me for the password.

   git clone https://code.google.com/p/23prime/



Had to do the following the first time.

git push origin master


You may want to look at the following tutorial:

 http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html



 git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://code.google.com/p/23prime/
  Push  URL: https://code.google.com/p/23prime/
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    master tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (up to date)



You cal also do the following:

  git commit -a -m 'Some text'

  git push




The following is pretty cool:

  gitk


It's also very easy to create experimental branches.

  git branch t0

You've added the following t0 branch. So list
it with the following command:

  git branch

     * master
     t0

So checkout the t0 branch

  git checkout t0


You can make edits, commit etc. Then, merge

  git checkout master
  git merge t0

Now you can delete the t0 branch

  git branch -d t0


So, you're only left with the master

  git branch

   * master



If you want to see everything can can be deleted without deleting:

  git clean -n -d -x

Once you're ready to clean everything

  git clean -f



This is the remote that I did with eclipse

git remote add bob ~/git/23prime
git fetch bob

# This following will show all the changes
git log -p master..bob/master


----------------------------------------------------------
Here I'm doing it with physiostat
----------------------------------------------------------


cd ~/dev/23prime/iphone/devwork/physiostat
git remote add physiostat ~/dev/chirico/Objective-C/iphone/devwork/physiostat
git fetch physiostat





You can get status on what has changed.

git diff  --stat

git config --global color.status auto
git config --global color.branch auto

You may want to ignore some files in git

~/dev/github/chirico$ cat .gitignore 
*.pyc
*.swp
*.log
.~
*.db
*.bak
boto.egg-info
build/
dist/
MANIFEST
bin

To list the tags

  git tag

To create a tag

  git tag version0.0 -m 'version 0.0'
  git push


Branching

 First list the branches

   git branch
     or if you want all the branches
   git banch -a

 Here's an example of creating a branch

   git branch test0
   git checkout test0
   git commit -a -m 'Branch test0'

 Now you can go back to the old one
   
   git checkout master

 You can merge or delete
   
   git merge test0
       or
   git branch -d test0


 To delete a file
   git rm junk


 To create a new branch without the last commit
   git checkout -b mybranch master~1

 To close a repository
   git clone git@github.com:mchirico/chirico.git
   git close git@github.com:mchirico/chirico.wiki.git



   

Now to commit these run

git ls-files
git show    #This will show what changed
git commit -a -m 'Updates'
git push





Currently I have 3 ssh keys
