This is one application you should have. Plus,
it's a good example.

  sudo port install md5sha1sum

You may want to update the ports:

  sudo port selfupdate

Now you probably want to list all the available ports

  port list

If you want information on a package, you can do the following:

  port info wget



Some packages you might want to install

  sudo port install nmap
  sudo port install md5sha1sum
  sudo port install htop


  port contents wget
