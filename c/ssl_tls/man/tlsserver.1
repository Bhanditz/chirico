.B -i
industries

.B -H [ mmddyyyy ], --history [ mmddyyyy]
history
.RS
This gives the history of the stock going back to mmddyyyy where mm is equal to the month, 
dd is the day and yyyy is the year. So the following would give the stock of Red Hat
going back to 2000.

.B stock rhat -H 01012000

   ...
   5-Jan-00,218.50,258.00,212.00,256.00,4664000,128.00
   4-Jan-00,228.00,229.00,215.00,215.00,1235600,107.50
   3-Jan-00,228.25,231.63,211.00,231.50,1620000,115.75

Use the date command along with this option. For example, to get the
last 100 days of a stock, you could use the following.

.B stock rhat -H `date -d '-100 day' '+%m%d%Y'`
