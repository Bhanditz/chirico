Quick take:

 There is duplicate code in the library.
 
 Should be a general cookie file, with the full
 cookie including expiration.


 There needs to be a general post. It should post to 
 anysite, anywhere.


 libs - start prototyping libs

 gpost - just got a working skeleton with options. 


There is a lot of cleanups. The first run is just
a prof on concept.

1. Static variables are not always the same length

2. May need to put results in a SQLite database (needed) for multiple
sites.

3. Build libraries.

Cookie: $Version="1"; Customer="WILE_E_COYOTE";
           $Path="/acme"


 The syntax for the header is:

   cookie          =       "Cookie:" cookie-version
                           1*((";" | ",") cookie-value)
   cookie-value    =       NAME "=" VALUE [";" path] [";" domain]
   cookie-version  =       "$Version" "=" value
   NAME            =       attr
   VALUE           =       value
   path            =       "$Path" "=" value
   domain          =       "$Domain" "=" value

   The value of the cookie-version attribute must be the value from the
   Version attribute, if any, of the corresponding Set-Cookie response
   header.  Otherwise the value for cookie-version is 0.  The value for
   the path attribute must be the value from the Path attribute, if any,
   of the corresponding Set-Cookie response header.  Otherwise the
   attribute should be omitted from the Cookie request header.  The
   value for the domain attribute must be the value from the Domain
   attribute, if any, of the corresponding Set-Cookie response header.
   Otherwise the attribute should be omitted from the Cookie request
   header.
