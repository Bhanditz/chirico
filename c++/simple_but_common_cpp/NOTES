  Obviously you can customize the configure options.

  For example this is a way to install the program in the
  directory "/home/chirico/junk" with all the executables
  prefixed with "c2"

         ./configure --bindir=/home/chirico/junk --program-prefix=c2


NOTES ON MODIFYING configure.in and Makefile.am



  If rebuilding the configure and makefile, make changes to

          configure.in
          Makefile.am
 
  Then, run ./mdo to get the distribution files

          configure
          Makefile.in
          aclocal.m4
